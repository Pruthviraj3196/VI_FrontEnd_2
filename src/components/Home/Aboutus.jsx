              Be a pioneer by 2017. Over the past several years, the BI platform
              market has grown largely through companies investing in IT-led
              consolidation projects to standardize IT-centric BI platforms for
              large-scale systems of record. These have tended to be highly

              Data discovery is the new normal, but where do we go from here?
              Smart data discovery has the potential to expand access to
              sophisticated interactive analysis and insights to business
              consumers and nontraditional BI usersâ€”the approximately 70 percent
